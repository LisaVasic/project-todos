# Project Todos

The asignment was to build a todo app using React and Redux.
In the app you should be able to add, check/uncheck and delete a task. The app should also count either all tasks or the uncompleted ones.

## The problem

This project had a lot to grasp and break down. It was tricky fully understand how redux and slices work. I tried to plan both my design and code as much as I could beforehand and decided what components to use. I used styled components for the styling. 

If I had more time I would add icons to the app. I would work on the responsiveness and clean up the code better.
